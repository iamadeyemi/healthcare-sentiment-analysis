# 🏥 Leveraging Sentiment Analysis in Evaluating Service Quality through Online Healthcare Reviews

**Welcome!**  
This project explores how **natural language processing (NLP)** and **transformer-based models** like **BERT** and **RoBERTa** can be used to automatically analyze patient sentiments in online healthcare reviews. By doing so, we unlock the potential to **quantitatively assess healthcare service quality** based on real customer feedback.

## 💡 Project Overview

In a digital world where people freely express their experiences online, especially with healthcare services, these reviews are goldmines of insight. This study applies **sentiment analysis** to reviews of top health insurance companies, with the aim of:

- Classifying sentiments as **positive** or **negative**
- Understanding trends in public perception
- Enabling providers to enhance service delivery through data-backed decisions

Sentiment analysis empowers businesses to extract meaning from vast amounts of **unstructured data** (like text reviews) and use those insights to **streamline workflows, reduce manual processing**, and **enhance customer satisfaction**.

## 📂 Dataset

**Dataset Used:**  
🗂️ *Reviews for Top Health Insurance Companies*  
A publicly available dataset containing customer reviews focused on health insurance providers.

## 🧠 Models Used

We leveraged two powerful transformer-based models for classification:

- **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- **RoBERTa** (Robustly Optimized BERT Approach)

These models are state-of-the-art in understanding contextual and emotional nuances in human language.

### ⚙️ Model Evaluation Metrics
- ✅ Accuracy
- 🎯 Precision
- 🔄 Recall
- 📊 F1 Score

**Result:**  
BERT emerged as the top-performing model, demonstrating consistently **high accuracy** in classifying sentiments correctly across the dataset.
